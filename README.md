Sign-In & Registration Page (HTML & CSS Only)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a simple, static Sign-In and Registration page built entirely with HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript.
It demonstrates how to create a functional user interface for account registration and login navigation using only frontend technologies.

ðŸ“œ Notes

    This project does not handle backend or database storage.

    Form submission is not functional â€” itâ€™s a UI-only design.

    You can integrate it with PHP, Python, or Node.js for full functionality.
